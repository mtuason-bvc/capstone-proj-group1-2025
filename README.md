# ABC-Music-Tuner
ABC Music Tuner - Bow Valley Group 1 Project

The chromatic tuner is based on https://github.com/qiuxiang/tuner but has additional features added including:

-Changed label to Listening instead of "Auto" so that its more intuitive. This is to switch between Listening for notes or note playback.
-Being able to select from a predefined list of reference frequencies
-Select from note list by dragging through the list or using the next or previous buttons during playback mode
-disabled the wave histogram effect at the bottom of the screen (Can still be enabled by uncommenting a part of the code)
-disabled frequency value display (can still be enabled through the CSS)

Suggestions for future versions:
-Addition of a grand staff to show the note that is being listened or played
-Addition of buttons to next or previous octaves
-Musical instrument mode such as Guitar, Banjo, Violin, etc. and their different string tuning setup
