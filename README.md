## Chromatic Tuner
The chromatic tuner is based on [qiuxiang tuner](https://github.com/qiuxiang/tuner).  
### Additional features added:

- Changed label to Listening instead of "Auto" so that its more intuitive. This is to switch between Listening for notes or note playback.
- Being able to select from a predefined list of reference frequencies
- Select from note list by dragging through the list or using the next or previous buttons during playback mode
- disabled the wave histogram effect at the bottom of the screen (Can still be enabled by uncommenting a part of the code)
- disabled frequency value display (can still be enabled through the CSS)
- changes to the tuning meter to better show how flat or sharp the current listened note is
- nav bars to switch to the other modes such as drone and tanpura

Suggestions for future versions:
- Addition of a grand staff to show the note that is being listened or played
- Addition of buttons to skip to the next or previous octaves
- Musical instrument mode such as Guitar, Banjo, Violin, etc. and their different string tuning setup
